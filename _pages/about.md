I am currently a PhD student at the University of Waterloo. I am supervised by [Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/) and I am a member of the  [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab.

My research interests are cryptography and its applications with my current focus being secure and private collaborative machine learning. 

I received a Masters of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo. My masters thesis was on combinatorial cryptography, supervised by [Doug Stinson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/).
