<b>About</b>

My research interests are broadly in the development and evaluation of privacy tools; including the use of privacy mechanisms for data analysis. I aim to develop user accessible privacy technology through the parallel study of technical solutions for private computation (including private machine learning) alongside the corresponding user perceptions, concerns, and comprehension of these developments. 

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Waterloo. I am supervised by [Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb/) and I am a member of the  [Cryptography, Security, and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab.
I received a Masters of Mathematics from the University of Waterloo. My masters thesis was on combinatorial cryptography, supervised by [Doug Stinson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/).
