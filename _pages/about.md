<b>About</b><br/>

Bailey Kacsmar is an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/kacsmar">University of Alberta</a> and an Alberta machine intelligence institute (<a href="https://www.amii.ca/">Amii</a>) fellow. 
Her research interests are broadly in the development and evaluation of human-centered technical privacy solutions; including the use of privacy mechanisms for data analysis and AI. She aims to develop human-centered privacy technology through the parallel study of technical solutions for private computation (privacy in machine learning and private set intersections) alongside the corresponding user perceptions, concerns, and comprehension of these developments. 


Prior to joining University of Alberta, she received her PhD in Computer Science and her Masters of Mathematics, both from the University of Waterloo.

<b>Erdös Number Trivia</b><br/>
You can find Erdös trivia <a href="https://sites.google.com/oakland.edu/grossman/home/the-erdoes-number-project">here</a>, about what is an Erdös number and why the collaboration graphs are (mathematically) interesting. As a fun note, I have an Erdös number of two. A co-author of Paul Erdös is said to have an Erdös number of one, and there are 511 people with this number. One of them, Douglas R. Stinson, is a <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dstinson/coauthors.html">collaborator</a> of mine, which is why I have a two. Interestingly, your number (distance from Erdös via a collaboration graph), is likely smaller than you may expect.
