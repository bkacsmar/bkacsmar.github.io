<h2>Presentations</h2>
While presentation styles have some subjectivity and depend on the community you are presenting to, here's an overview of some relevant advice that will help you slide decks suport you as you present you r work to an audience. As I revise this page, I will also link to some of my favorite presentation advice documents that others have written. 


<h1>Content Selection</h1>
Many times, a presentation is on  a research project, a paper, your thesis, or a combination of these things. Regardless of what it is, you will almost certainly be unable to fit everything from that work into an oral presentation. That means you will have to be selective, know your audience, and start by identifying what absolutely must be conveyed. In some cases, if your talk is really short (5-7 minutes or even one minute), then your focus may be on trying to say the important information that will convince your audience that they want to read your paper and that it will be interesting to them. No matter the length though, the following is probably going to work as a good foundation. What each of these points corresponds to will still be domain and audience dependent though. 
<ul>
  <li>Problem statement: what is the space you are in, why is it important, what is the nature of the problem</li>
  <li>Methodology: you don't need every detail about how you did this work, but the basic idea should be conveyed. Theory (theorems, proofs, proof automation)? Empirical Experiments (datasets, simulations)? HCI (Interviews, surveys...)?</li>
  <li>Core results: depending on the length of the presentation you may not be able to highlight all your results. Focus on the most important ones, the ones that are impactful, or even are your favorite.</li>
  <li>Takeaway: what should people leave your talk knowing, how can your work change or help with things they may be working on</li>
</ul>

<h1>Slide Layouts</h1>
Some of these you may consider more of a than strongly advisable, but I have included some explanations to help you determine whether they make sense for your presentation
<ul>
  <li>White space: if your slide is too crowded, things will be missed. Ideally, you want to make it easy for people to identify the important points. White space can also help divide things when you want to convey more than one concept on a slide. </li>
  <li>Slide numbers: including these helps if people want to reference a particular slide when they ask you a question as well as allows you to track your progress even in the case where you may not have a presenter view and can only see your slides</li>
</ul>
