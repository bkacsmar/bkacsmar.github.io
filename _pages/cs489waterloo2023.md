<h2>CS489 Privacy, Cryptography, Network and Data Security</h2>

 This course provides an introduction to data privacy and security, using cryptography and related techniques in networks, distributed systems and data science. It examines how data and meta-data can be protected at rest, in transit and during computation. Students completing this course should be able to use and deploy data security and privacy protection technologies in networks and (distributed) data science environments. In layman terms, this course shows you how to benefit from the Internet and machine learning and still preserve individuals' privacy. 
 
 This course complements CS458 which provides a wider set of security and privacy techniques also in other areas, but doesn't study these techniques in the detail as this course does. Audience Fourth year CS students (CS 489), or first year CS graduate students (CS 689) 
 
 Prerequisites: MATH135 or MATH145
 
 Computer science students only co-requisites: CS454 or CS456 
 
 Antirequisites: None. This course can be taken after, in parallel or in place of CS458. It provides more detailed material on a subset of techniques mentioned in CS458.
