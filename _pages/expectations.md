<h2>Expectations</h2>
First of all, understand that this is directed at security and privacy researchers, in particular for those in my group or interested in joining it. Therefore, while some of the statements may generalize, not all of them will. In particular, recognize that different areas have different types of work; which relates to whether they produce theorems/proofs, empirical (algorithmic) evaluation, or human empirical work. Further, different institutions and even different advisors within the same institution, may have very different expectaitons. 

<h3>Masters Specific</h3>
Your masters degree is roughly speaking between one and two years. I am specifically refering to the Canadian style of a thesis-based masters degree here. In this degree you will complete a set of courses (here at UofA, this is four) as well as complete a research thesis.
