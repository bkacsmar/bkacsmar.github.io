<h2>Practical Usable Privacy and Security</h2>
We focus on developing privacy enhancing systems using human-centered design. That is, when developing technical privacy protocols, we do so informed by the end privacy goals of the entities whoes privacy can be effected by whether their data is used in such systems.

<b>Practical privacy?</b>
On one side of practicality, we need to ensure that technical guarantees are enforced and that they can be done with "reasonable" time and resources requirments. A practical privacy system must also have sufficient utility. For instance, if a "privately trained" machine learning model does not achieve a certain level of success (e.g., at classification or generation) it is not able to serve its purpose. 


<b>Usable privacy?</b>
The usability of a privacy system has several facets to it. It includes aspects of what users actually do and what do they want to do. However, it also includes the accessibility of the system.
